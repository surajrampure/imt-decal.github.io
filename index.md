## Summary and Goals

A large subset of the students entering Berkeley's Computer Science program don't have the mathematical preparation necessary to succeed in Berkeley's highly theoretical curriculum. Students with extracurricular math preparation in high school tend to find courses such as CS 70, CS 170 and Math 55 significantly easier than students without this background.

We believe the Introduction to Mathematical Thinking DeCal can help bridge this gap.

**The primary goal of this course is to have students develop mathematical maturity.** Our curriculum is devoted to exposing students to concepts they may have seen before, but to present these concepts in a more precise, generalized way. By the end of our course, students will be able to:
  - comfortably read mathematical language, including notation, definitions and proofs
  - generalize concepts and techniques introduced in class to harder novel problems
  - concisely and clearly express their ideas
  - differentiate between a good proof and a proof with logical gaps

As a result, this course will prepare students for higher-level mathematics courses, such as CS 70 at Berkeley. With that being said, students need not plan on taking CS 70 to take this course; we will allow students to enroll in the course out of interest.

TBD, subject to approval.

## Content

A textbook is being written specifically for this course. It will be available for free at [book.imt-decal.org](https://introduction-to-mathematical-t.gitbooks.io/book/content/). There will also be lecture videos embedded into the textbook; this is still a work in progress.

There will be a take-home midterm assignment, as well as a final exam in class.
