<h3 id="description" style="color:#4d9d91;">Course Description</h3>
<p>Berkeley’s highly theoretical Computer Science curriculum demands a high level of mathematical maturity. While those with extracurricular math experience from high school are familiar with dense notation, complex mathematical objects, and proof techniques, many students find foundational courses like CS 70, CS 170, and Math 55 confusing and inaccessible.</p>
<p>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking bridges the gap.</p>
<p><strong>We teach mathematical maturity.</strong> Our curriculum exposes students to familiar concepts in a more precise, generalized way. By the end of our course, students will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>comfortably read mathematical language, including notation, definitions and proofs</li>
<li>concisely and clearly express their ideas differentiate between a good proof and a proof with logical gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, this course will prepare students for higher-level mathematics courses, such as CS 70 at Berkeley. However, students can enroll in the course even if they aren’t planning on taking these courses or are not in CS/EECS; these skills and concepts are highly transferrable.</p>

<p>There are <strong>no prerequisites</strong> for this course. We're working really hard to make the material accessible for all backgrounds.</p>
<p><br></p>


<h3 id="logistics" style="color:#4d9d91;">Logistics</h3>
<p>The course will be offered for 2 units, P/NP. There will be one 1.5h lecture per week, and one 1.5h discussion per week. There will be weekly problem sets, which are taken up in discussion section after students have had a few days to attempt the problems. They are not to be submitted.</p>
<p>Students' grades for the course are determined on a 100-point scale.
<ul>
<li> <strong>Weekly surveys (5 points x 10 surveys = 50 points)</strong>: Problem sets aren't collected, but it is still expected that students attempt them. Each week, there will be a form released where students indicate how much of the problem set they attempted and how well they understood the content. Surveys may also include a short problem that should take less than half an hour to complete.</li>
<li> <strong>Midterm (20 points)</strong>: A take-home midterm problem set, which students will have a week to complete individually.</li>
<li> <strong>Final (30 points)</strong>: An in-class final examination at the end of the semester.</li>
</ul>
Students will need 75 points to pass the course, which roughly corresponds to filling out every survey and earning half of the points on both exams.

<p>A textbook is being written specifically for this course. It will be available for free at <a style="color:#4d9d91;text-decoration:none;" href="http://book.imt-decal.org">book.imt-decal.org</a>. There will also be lecture videos embedded into the textbook; this is still a work in progress.</p>
