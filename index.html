<h3 id="description" style="color:#4d9d91;">Course Description</h3>
<p>Berkeley’s highly theoretical Computer Science curriculum demands a high level of mathematical maturity. While those with extracurricular math experience from high school are familiar with dense notation, complex mathematical objects, and proof techniques, many students find foundational courses like CS 70, CS 170, and Math 55 confusing and inaccessible.</p>
<p>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking bridges the gap.</p>
<p><strong>We teach mathematical maturity.</strong> Our curriculum exposes students to familiar concepts in a more precise, generalized way. By the end of our course, students will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>comfortably read mathematical language, including notation, definitions and proofs</li>
<li>concisely and clearly express their ideas differentiate between a good proof and a proof with logical gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, this course will prepare students for higher-level mathematics courses, such as CS 70 at Berkeley. However, students can enroll in the course even if they aren’t planning on taking these courses or are not in CS/EECS; these skills and concepts are highly transferrable.</p>

<p>There are <strong>no prerequisites</strong> for this course. We're working really hard to make the material accessible for all backgrounds.</p>
<p><br></p>


<h3 id="grading" style="color:#4d9d91;">Grading</h3>
<p>The course will be offered for 2 units, P/NP. There will be one 1.5h lecture each Wednesday, and one 1.5h discussion each Monday. There will be weekly problem sets, which are released on Wednesdays at 8PM taken up in discussion section the following Monday after students have had a few days to attempt the problems. Problem sets will be graded on effort, and are due exactly a week after released (the following Wednesday, at 8PM). Problem sets will be submitted on Gradescope (code TBD). </p>
<p>Students' grades for the course are determined on a 100-point scale.
<ul>
<li> <strong>Problem sets (5 points x 10 problem sets = 50 points)</strong>: Students will either receive a 5, 2 or 0 on each problem set, corresponding to an attempt to most problems, an attempt to some problems, and no submission, respectively. </li>
<li> <strong>Midterm (20 points)</strong>: A take-home midterm problem set, which students will have a week to complete individually.</li>
<li> <strong>Final (30 points)</strong>: An in-class final examination at the end of the semester.</li>
</ul>
Students will need 70 points to pass the course, which roughly corresponds to a 5 on nine problem sets and earning half of the points on both exams. As this is a new course, we reserve the right to adjust this boundary and the point system as a whole as the course progresses, but we will do so in a fair way.

<h3 id="schedule" style="color:#4d9d91;">Content and Schedule</h3>
<p>A textbook is being written specifically for this course. It is available for free at <a style="color:#4d9d91;text-decoration:none;" href="http://book.imt-decal.org">book.imt-decal.org</a>. There will also be lecture videos embedded into the textbook; this is still a work in progress.</p>

<h3 id="faq" style="color:#4d9d91;"> Frequently Asked Questions </h3>

<br>

<b> When should I take this course? </b> We think this course is best taken the semester before taking CS 70. Therefore, if you plan on taking CS 70 in Spring 2019, Fall 2018 would be the time to take it. With that being said, you can take this course even if you don't plan on taking CS 70, but due to constraints, we won't be admitting many students from this category (perhaps in future semesters).

<br><br>

<b> How do I know that this course is for me? </b> This course is designed for students without discrete math experience. In general, if you have significant math contest experience, or did well in a discrete math course prior to being at Berkeley, then this course probably isn't for you. 

Take a look at <a style="color:#4d9d91;text-decoration:none;" href='assets/diagnostic.pdf'>this diagnostic assessment</a>. If a lot of this material seems unfamiliar to you, we'd be glad to have you!

<br><br>

<b> How much work will it be? </b> We know you have other courses in which your grade matters. However, the only way to actually develop and retain skills from this course is to put in the time into coming to lecture and discussion, reading the book/watching lecture videos, and (most importantly) doing the homework. Not including time spent in class, a rough estimate is 5 hours per week. 

<br><br>

<b> Can I audit this course? </b> Sadly, we won't have space for that. However, all materials – lecture notes, the textbook, lecture videos, assignments, exams – will be posted online.
